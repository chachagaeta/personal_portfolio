# Charlotte's Portfolio Website

## Project Overview and Purpose

This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my background as a Computer Science student. The site features an aesthetic design with custom graphics and highlights three major projects I've worked on: Webz board game, VacayShare, and EquityNest. The portfolio serves as a digital resume and contact point for potential employers, collaborators, and fellow developers.
